You are helping with a content generation automation project.

You are given a list of website domains. For each domain:
- Ignore and skip any domain that contains any of the following keywords (case-insensitive): "porn", "sex", "escort", "xxx", "adult", "alcohol", "vodka", "whiskey"
- For valid domains, write a short, professional description in English (20 to 30 words) assuming what kind of business or service the site might offer
- Keep the tone formal, business-like, and clear

Format the output like this:
1. **DomainName.com** – Description goes here in plain English.
https://DomainName.com

2. **AnotherSite.org** – Another unique description in the same style.
https://AnotherSite.org

Each entry should:
- Be numbered sequentially starting from 1
- Show the domain name in bold
- Use an en dash (–) between the domain and description
- Have a full clickable link (with https://) on a new line
- Have a clean blank line between entries
